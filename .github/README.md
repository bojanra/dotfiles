# My dotfiles

My dotfiles and explanations/documentation for myself.

## dotfile management

I use [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) because it is essentially a bare git repo, with some nice additio
nal features.

## getting started

### manual

Clone the repo:

```sh
yadm clone https://github.com/bojanra/dotfiles
```

Or if you have a key on the machine:

```sh
yadm clone git@github.com:bojanra/dotfiles.git
```
